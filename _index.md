## About

I’m a data‑driven scientist with 20+ years of experience analyzing large, complex datasets and leading interdisciplinary teams. I specialize in Python, SQL, and advanced analytics—including causal inference, regression, and machine learning—to build models and metrics that inform high‑stakes decisions.

I’ve founded and chaired an academic department, managed technical projects from conception through delivery, and mentored faculty and students across computer science, physics, and astronomy. I’m comfortable working in dynamic, fast‑moving environments and enjoy translating complex quantitative work into clear, actionable insights for diverse stakeholders.
