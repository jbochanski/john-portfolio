     I’m a data-driven scientist with 20+ years of experience analyzing large,
      complex datasets and leading interdisciplinary teams. I specialize in
      Python, SQL, and advanced analytics—including causal inference, regression,
      and machine learning—to build models and metrics that inform high-stakes
      decisions.

      I’ve founded and chaired an academic department, managed technical projects
      from conception through delivery, and mentored faculty and students across
      computer science, physics, and astronomy. I enjoy translating complex
      quantitative work into clear, actionable insights for diverse stakeholders.
